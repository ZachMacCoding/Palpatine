	<h2>About The Senate</h2>
	<p>Hi everyone! I am yours truly Sheev Palpatine, but that's the senate to you! I have forceful personality and am always up for a good time. BDSM is preferable, and even better if you can handle it being electrifying. If you can't, DON'T EVEN BOTHER MESSAGING ME!!! As I am The Senate, I can whisk you away to your favourite place in the galaxy, and I can  show you a few favourite places of my own; I here the seas of Mustafar are beautiful this time of year! <br><br> Besides my favourite places, there's also my favourite person, Lord Vader. Now, he might not be the most approachable person at first, but I'm sure you'll be able form a magnificent relationship with him over time. If you're having trouble, just try spinning, that's a good trick. And if you can't deal with that, again: DON'T EVEN BOTHER MESSAGING ME!! And final note before we get into my lovely characteristics: I am a lover not a fighter. But, if you get on my wrong side, I won't hesitate to hold a dimplomatic conference to iron out some issues. Now, on to the characteristics!  </p>

	<h2>My Friends</h2>
	<p>I have had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful people throughout my career. Not just politicians, but also the regular people that they govern over. Across various star systems, I have come into contact with several forms of civilisation, and I have found that it's always a rewarding experience to connect with these people and give back to the community. As The Senate, it is not only my duty, but my honor. Therefore, it is with great reluctance and sadness that I have had to narrow down my selection of friends in the following list due to the limitations of this holonet blogging service. For all the wonderful souls I have left out, please do not think too ill of me, for I am a lonely man, and to do what must be done is always the greatest sacrifice. To finalise, I want to reiterate and emphasise that I am a friend of the people, and most importantly, I am a friend of peace. Click on the Links below to see my top 3 friends:</p>
