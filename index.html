	<h2>About The Senate</h2>
	<p>Hi everyone! I am yours truly Sheev Palpatine, but that's the senate to you! I have forceful personality and am always up for a good time. BDSM is preferable, and even better if you can handle it being electrifying. If you can't, DON'T EVEN BOTHER MESSAGING ME!!! As I am The Senate, I can whisk you away to your favourite place in the galaxy, and I can  show you a few favourite places of my own; I here the seas of Mustafar are beautiful this time of year! Besides my favourite places, there's also my favourite person, Lord Vader. Now, he might not be the most approachable person at first, but I'm sure you'll be able form a magnificent relationship. If you're at a loss, try asking him about spinning, I hear that's a good trick. And if you can't deal with that, AGAIN don't even BOTHER!! Just a final note here: I am a lover not a fighter. But, if you get on my wrong side, I won't hesitate to hold a dimplomatic conference to iron out some issues. Now, on to the characteristics!  </p>

	<h2>My Friends</h2>
	<p>I have had the pleasure of meeting many wondeful people throughout my career. Not just politicians, but also the regular people that they govern over. Across various star systems, I have come into contact several kinds of civilisation, and I have found that It's always a rewarding experience to connect with these people give back to the community. As The Senate, that is not only my duty, but my honor. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I narrow down this list of my friends, but know this! It wasn't without great sadness However, I am a lonely man, and to do what must be done is always the greatest sacrifice. However, I must reiterate that I am a friend of everyone, and most importantly, I am a friend of peace. Click on the Links below to see my most important friends:</p>
